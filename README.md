# FA-Phys-Frequency-Attention-PhysNet
FA-Phys is a lightweight deep learning framework for remote physiological signal estimation (rPPG)from facial videos.   The model introduces a **Frequency Attention Module** that explicitly focuses on physiologically meaningful heart-rate frequency bands, enabling robust and accurate prediction under motion, illumination, and background variations.

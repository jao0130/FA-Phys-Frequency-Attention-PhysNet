# FA-Phys: Frequency Attention PhysNet

FA-Phys is a lightweight deep learning framework for **remote physiological signal estimation (rPPG)** from facial videos.  
The model introduces a **Frequency Attention Module** that explicitly focuses on physiologically meaningful heart-rate frequency bands, enabling robust and accurate prediction under motion, illumination, and background variations.

## 🔍 Motivation
Remote photoplethysmography aims to estimate physiological signals such as heart rate (HR) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂) without physical contact.  
However, real-world scenarios suffer from motion noise, illumination changes, and background interference.

FA-Phys addresses these challenges by:
- Incorporating **frequency-domain priors** into deep learning
- Enhancing temporal modeling with minimal computational overhead
- Achieving strong performance with significantly fewer parameters
